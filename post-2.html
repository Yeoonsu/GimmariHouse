            <h3>The Exam That Never Asked What Happiness Is</h3>
<p>Is this not why we all work so hard? 
Since &quot;consequences&quot; are far-off in the future, it feels fine for now.</p>
<p>I, too, pushed myself into dangerous limits to avoid being &quot;unlucky.&quot; 
I endured and struggled just to escape the grip of industrial accidents. 
A <em>labor union</em> is a collective of people who have made such efforts—so why should we include those like non-regular workers, who haven&#39;t <em>tried as hard as</em> I have?</p>
<p>It is utterly unbearable to see someone who seems just like me receive better treatment than I do.</p>
<p>We all have the same black hair, the same black eyes, and we eat Dubai sticky cookies and Tanghulu at the same time, whether in Seoul or Jeju. 
Because we all look the same, I cannot believe in invisible things like <em>&quot;innate aptitude&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;talent.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Anyone can excel at studies if they just try. 
What use is the &quot;scribbling&quot; of a four-year-old who fails a spelling bee but has a gift for art? 
Art, such things do not help GDP growth or OECD rankings.
It’s simply because that four-year-old didn&#39;t try hard enough to learn the Korean alphabet. 
Only when one becomes a wildly successful webtoon creator and appears in the media does their talent finally become <em>&quot;visible.&quot;</em>
Only then is it worthy of recognition.</p>
<p>She was just lucky. 
She grew up comfortably in a wealthy home with <em>&quot;good&quot;</em> parents. 
If I had been given that same abundance of private education and mentoring—if only I had that environment—I surely would have earned a high salary just like her. 
Her high wages are mere <em>luck</em>. 
I, the unlucky one, entered a humble local university and clawed my way into a financial institution while others were drinking and playing. 
That is why, when I meet my friends and colleagues, I boast of my salary and my status.</p>
<p>My peers all look up to me. 
So, how dare she—who didn&#39;t even try—enter through a process incomparably easier than that of a regular employee and receive such high pay? 
I hate her. 
This is clearly <em>unfair</em>; it is a <em>privilege</em>.</p>
<p>To work in a safe office like me, they should have <em>&quot;tried hard,&quot;</em> just as I did when I was born with the same resources and situations. 
They did not try hard enough. 
I endured. 
Therefore, I rightfully deserve the joy of the winner.</p>
<p>When I was powerless, weak, and expecting defeat, I never knew I could fight back.
I never learned that I don&#39;t always have to fight—that simply by warning the other party, I could protect my own sense of justice against the strong using my <em>&quot;invisible power.&quot;</em></p>
<p>That is why, until now, I have gritted my teeth and invested every penny and every second to acquire &quot;visible power.&quot; 
It’s not because I am greedy or evil and want to steal from others.
It is simply to survive.</p>
<p>I got into a prestigious university, 
attained a profession others cannot ignore, 
drove an expensive German car, 
and finally bought a costly &quot;Castle&quot; in Seoul 
with a 30-year mortgage from the bank. 
I must pay off that mortgage. 
I must survive in my workplace until the very end, enduring injustice and insults. 
So, even if another weak colleague suffers sexual harassment or verbal abuse, I simply cannot help them. 
If you&#39;re unhappy with that, why don&#39;t you work harder and become stronger yourself? 
I never learned that a weak person could fight, so I simply cannot believe it.</p>
<p>If you reveal your story to the media, 
&quot;dopamine addicts&quot; will rage alongside you. 
But those addicts do not want the victim to find peace. 
The victim must suffer more. 
Only then can the addicts get more stimulation and feel &quot;happy.&quot; 
But, Happiness is just a provocative, fleeting emotion—it is not paradise. 
The easiest and fastest way to be happy is drugs. Yet, no one agrees with using drugs.</p>
<p>If you ask why we must earn money, the answer is &quot;Option C: Happiness.&quot; 
The question &quot;What is happiness?&quot; never appeared on the exam!</p>
<p>But... now that I think about it... Happiness is... living snugly with my family and friends...</p>
<p>That means &quot;peace.&quot;</p>
<p>But to be such <em>peaceful</em>, one must be strong. 
And strong power is visible power: <strong>money</strong>. 
So, I must earn money.</p>
<p>Happiness is sweet, but peace is just old-fashioned and worn out. 
The effort required for peace is uncomfortable, painful, and even agonizing.</p>
<p>So today, to earn money, 
instead of a warm, boring tea that soothes the body, 
I drink an Iced Americano and an energy drink to snap awake from my lack of sleep.</p>
<p>No one intends to spend their own money or time to fight against the injustice done to a victim. 
I, the weak one, cannot do it, so I hope someone strong will appear and strike down the perpetrator.
Even watching the ruin of a perpetrator is refreshing—like a cold soda. 
In the media, this cycle repeats endlessly.</p>
<p>And so, many victims were murdered. 
Because the perpetrators—society and the system—are <em>invisible</em>, this tragedy is called an <em>&quot;extreme choice.&quot;</em> We call it suicide.</p>
<p>🙂
