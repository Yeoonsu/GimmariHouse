    <div class="content">
        
            
                <p>&lt;h1&gt;The Price of Visible Power&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;h3&gt;Not any more Missiles to the East Sea.&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 4 AM for a &amp;quot;Miracle Morning,&amp;quot; endure the hellish subway from 6 to 8, work in the office from 9 AM until 10 PM, push through a Personal Training(PT) session at the gym, and finally take a taxi home only to barely fall asleep— Why are you bothering me?&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I need even a few more minutes of sleep. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>We need nuclear missiles approved by the United States! </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I can never believe that we can fight the strong with nothing but invisible power. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Have we not clearly seen and experienced the tragedy of Japanese colonization and the Korean War, where our own families fought one another? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>That was not a long time ago. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>It is the very life our grandmothers and grandfathers endured.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>It is only because our fathers and mothers struggled to possess sufficient, visible power that we finally.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;We are on the verge of the G7. Look! </p>
            
        
            
                <p>No nation in the world dares to invade us now. When our fathers went abroad, who even knew of &amp;quot;South Korea&amp;quot;? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>But when our daughters go abroad now, they are treated as guests from a wealthy nation with a powerful culture—a strong country.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>That is the power of visible strength. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>How can anyone believe in an invisible power that is worn-out, old-fashioned, quietly stagnant, and sometimes agonizing? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>That alone could never protect us.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;We must continue to whip and abuse ourselves for the sake of &amp;quot;peace&amp;quot; so that we can remain brilliantly safe within our Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;While I work and study, the poor, pitiful, conscripted sons of others—from &amp;quot;the other family&amp;quot;— will fight in our stead. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>It is thanks to such invisible sacrifices that we have been able to achieve this dazzling growth. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>For us to be &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; together, things like &amp;quot;peace&amp;quot; must be willingly sacrificed. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Only then can we live snugly alongside our neighbors— Russia, China, North Korea, and Japan— under the comfortable protection of the United States, which is too far away to ever seem like it would invade the land right before our eyes. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>The price of protection paid to the powerful is &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt;, so it is fine.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;That is how we survived. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>But because of the &amp;quot;selfishness&amp;quot; of not wanting to pass this terrible tragedy down to the next generation, I have decided not to have children...&lt;/p&gt;</p>
