                <p>&lt;h1&gt;The Exam That Never Asked What Happiness Is&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;h3&gt;Our society said,&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;Is this not why we all work so hard? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Since &amp;quot;consequences&amp;quot; are far-off in the future, it feels fine for now.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I, too, pushed myself into dangerous limits to avoid being &amp;quot;unlucky.&amp;quot; </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I endured and struggled just to escape the grip of industrial accidents. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>A &lt;em&gt;labor union&lt;/em&gt; is a collective of people who have made such efforts—so why should we include those like non-regular workers, who haven&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;tried as hard as&lt;/em&gt; I have?&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;It is utterly unbearable to see someone who seems just like me receive better treatment than I do.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;We all have the same black hair, the same black eyes, and we eat Dubai sticky cookies and Tanghulu at the same time, whether in Seoul or Jeju. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Because we all look the same, I cannot believe in invisible things like &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;innate aptitude&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;talent.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;Anyone can excel at studies if they just try. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>What use is the &amp;quot;scribbling&amp;quot; of a four-year-old who fails a spelling bee but has a gift for art? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Art, such things do not help GDP growth or OECD rankings.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>It’s simply because that four-year-old didn&amp;#39;t try hard enough to learn the Korean alphabet. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Only when one becomes a wildly successful webtoon creator and appears in the media does their talent finally become &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;visible.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>Only then is it worthy of recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;She was just lucky. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>She grew up comfortably in a wealthy home with &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;good&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; parents. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>If I had been given that same abundance of private education and mentoring—if only I had that environment—I surely would have earned a high salary just like her. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Her high wages are mere &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I, the unlucky one, entered a humble local university and clawed my way into a financial institution while others were drinking and playing. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>That is why, when I meet my friends and colleagues, I boast of my salary and my status.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;My peers all look up to me. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>So, how dare she—who didn&amp;#39;t even try—enter through a process incomparably easier than that of a regular employee and receive such high pay? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I hate her. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>This is clearly &lt;em&gt;unfair&lt;/em&gt;; it is a &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;To work in a safe office like me, they should have &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;tried hard,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; just as I did when I was born with the same resources and situations. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>They did not try hard enough. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I endured. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Therefore, I rightfully deserve the joy of the winner.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;When I was powerless, weak, and expecting defeat, I never knew I could fight back.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>I never learned that I don&amp;#39;t always have to fight—that simply by warning the other party, I could protect my own sense of justice against the strong using my &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;invisible power.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;That is why, until now, I have gritted my teeth and invested every penny and every second to acquire &amp;quot;visible power.&amp;quot; </p>
            
        
            
                <p>It’s not because I am greedy or evil and want to steal from others.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>It is simply to survive.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;I got into a prestigious university, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>attained a profession others cannot ignore, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>drove an expensive German car, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>and finally bought a costly &amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; in Seoul </p>
            
        
            
                <p>with a 30-year mortgage from the bank. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I must pay off that mortgage. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I must survive in my workplace until the very end, enduring injustice and insults. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>So, even if another weak colleague suffers sexual harassment or verbal abuse, I simply cannot help them. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>If you&amp;#39;re unhappy with that, why don&amp;#39;t you work harder and become stronger yourself? </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I never learned that a weak person could fight, so I simply cannot believe it.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;h3&gt;Mary said,&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;If you reveal your story to the media, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>&amp;quot;dopamine addicts&amp;quot; will rage alongside you. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>But those addicts do not want the victim to find peace. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>The victim must suffer more. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Only then can the addicts get more stimulation and feel &amp;quot;happy.&amp;quot; </p>
            
        
            
                <p>But, Happiness is just a provocative, fleeting emotion—it is not paradise. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>The easiest and fastest way to be happy is drugs. Yet, no one agrees with using drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;If you ask why we must earn money, the answer is &amp;quot;Option C: Happiness.&amp;quot; </p>
            
        
            
                <p>But the question &amp;quot;What is happiness?&amp;quot; never appeared on the exam!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;h3&gt;They said,&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;But... now that I think about it... Happiness is... living snugly with my family and friends...&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;That means &amp;quot;peace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;But to be such &lt;em&gt;peaceful&lt;/em&gt;, one must be strong. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>And strong power is visible power: &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>So, I must earn money.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;Happiness is sweet, but peace is just old-fashioned and worn out. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>The effort required for peace is uncomfortable, painful, and even agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;So today, to earn money, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>instead of a warm, boring tea that soothes the body, </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I drink an Iced Americano and an energy drink to snap awake from my lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;No one intends to spend their own money or time to fight against the injustice done to a victim. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>I, the weak one, cannot do it, so I hope someone strong will appear and strike down the perpetrator.</p>
            
        
            
                <p>Even watching the ruin of a perpetrator is refreshing—like a cold soda. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>In the media, this cycle repeats endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;And so, many victims were murdered. </p>
            
        
            
                <p>Because the perpetrators—society and the system—are &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt;, this tragedy is called an &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;extreme choice.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Suicide&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            
        
            
                <p>&lt;p&gt;🙂&lt;/p&gt;</p>
